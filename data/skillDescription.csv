Amazon: Call Santa,"This holiday season, Alexa has a special surprise to delight the little ones - the chance to call Santa Claus himself. Kids can say, ""Alexa, open Call Santa Claus,"" and Alexa will connect them to Old St. Nick and all his friends at the North Pole. Callers can sing carols to help Santa’s musical sleigh fly, laugh along with squabbling elves, and even build a snowman with Blitzen the reindeer. Created with Christmas cheer at the heart of every story, these festive adventures aim to have your family ho-ho-ho-ing along with Santa and his friends. Households with Echo Show devices can also view Santa and company on video, where magical animation brings the winter wonderland to life. Troubleshooting: Some customers have reported Alexa calling a contact which includes ""Santa"" in the name, or reaching a different Santa voicemail skill instead of Amazon's Call Santa skill. If you experience either of these issues, try saying, “Alexa, Open Call Santa Claus” instead."
